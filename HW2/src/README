--How to Compile
  Go in "HW2/src/" directory, enter the following command:
  $ make
  An executalbe file "hw2" will be generated in "HW2/bin" directory

  If you want to delete executable file, just enter the following command in the "HW2/src/" directory
  $ make clean

--How to test and verify
  There are two python files in "HW2/src/" directory, you can enter the following command to execute program with the 6 test cases in "HW2/testcase/" directory.   
  $ python testTime.py
  This command will also generate the 6 corresponding output files in "HW2/output" directory, and a file named time.txt in "HW2/src/" directory. "time.txt" file will have the information about runtime the program used.

  Another python files is used to check whether the output file is legal or not. It will envoke verify file under "HW2/verifier/verify" with 6 outputfiles in "HW2/output" directory
  $ python testVerify.py
  This command will also generate a file name "verify.txt" under "HW2/src" directory, this file will have the result of verification.

--How to Run
  Usage:(under "HW2/src" directory)
  ../bin/hw2 ../testcase/<txt file> ../output/<output file>

  e.g.
  enter following command in "HW2/src" directory:
  ../bin/hw2 ../testcase/public1.txt ../output/public1.out
